Assuming you have a Players model:

You can add sortable columns, member actions and sorting like this:

  #app/admin/players.rb
  ActiveAdmin.register Player do
    # Sort players by position
    config.sort_order = 'position'

    # Add member actions for positioning.
    sortable_member_actions

    index do
      # This adds columns for moving up, down, top and bottom.
      sortable_column
      # You can pass a block with a custom path for the resource like
      # sortable_column { |resource| resource_path(resource) }

      #...
      column :firstname
      column :lastname
      default_actions
    end
